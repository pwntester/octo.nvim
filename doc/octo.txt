INTRODUCTION                                    *octo*

Edit and review GitHub issues, pull requests, and discussions from the comfort
of your favorite editor.

Use `gO` to access the contents of this helpfile.


USAGE                                           *octo-usage*

Edit the issue title, body, or comments, as a regular buffer and use `:w(rite)`
to sync the issue with GitHub.


LUA API                                         *octo-lua-api*

The plugin exposes a Lua API to iteract with GitHub CLI which powers the
plugin.

The `octo.gh` module is meant to mirror the GitHub CLI as closely as possible.
For example, >lua

    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    gh.issue.list {}
<

This is equivalent to running `gh issue list` in the terminal.

Any CLI arguments can be passed as well. For example, >lua

    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    gh.issue.list { label = "bug", limit = 5, state = "closed" }
<

This is same as `gh issue list --label "bug" --limit 5 --state "closed"` in
the terminal. Note: For parameters with `-`, use an `_` in the key instead.  For
example, `--add-assignee` becomes `add_assignee` in the Lua API.

Consult the GitHub CLI documentation for the available commands and
parameters at <https://cli.github.com/manual/> or use the `--help` flag.

By default, nothing is returned since the commands are asynchronous. Pass a
callback function to `cb` in the `opts` keyword: >lua

    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    gh.issue.list {
        opts = {
            cb = function(stdout, stderr, exit_code)
                vim.notify(stdout)
                vim.notify(stderr)
                vim.notify(exit_code)
            end,
        }
    }
<

Handle the output as needed directly use the `gh.create_callback` helper to
handle success and failure cases: >lua

    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    gh.issue.list {
        opts = {
            cb = gh.create_callback {
                success = function(stdout)
                    vim.notify("Success: " .. stdout)
                end,
                failure = function(stderr)
                    vim.notify("Error: " .. stderr)
                end,
            }
        }
    }
<

Use the defaults of `gh.create_callback` to notify the user on the stdout and
stderr automatically: >lua

    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    gh.issue.list {
        opts = {
            cb = gh.create_callback {},
        }
    }
<

The `mode` can be passed as well in order to access the output synchronous:
>lua
    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    local stdout, stderr, exit_code = gh.issue.list { opts = { mode = "sync" } }
<

Similarly, the REST and GraphQL endpoints can be used as well: >lua

    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    gh.api { "/notifications" }
<
This is equivalent to running `gh api /notifications` in the terminal.

Common REST actions are exposed for convenience: >lua

    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    -- Get
    gh.api.get(opts)

    ---Post
    gh.api.post(opts)

    --- Patch
    gh.api.patch(opts)

    --- Delete
    gh.api.delete(opts)
<

The GraphQL endpoint is also available. For example,
>lua
    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    gh.api.graphql {
        f = { query = "query { viewer { login } }" },
        jq = ".data.viewer.login",
    }
<
This is the same as >terminal

    gh api graphql -f query='query { viewer { login } }' --jq '.data.viewer.login'
<
in the terminal. Note: Single character keys are passed with single `-` in
the CLI.

Parameterized queries are also possible mirroring the syntax in CLI. Just pass
lua objects directly:
>lua
    local gh = require "octo.gh"

    gh.api.graphql {
        f = {
            query = [[
            query($owner: String!, $name: String!) {
                repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
                    issues(first: 1) {
                        totalCount
                    }
                    pullRequests(first: 1) {
                        totalCount
                    }
                    discussions(first: 1) {
                        totalCount
                    }
                }
            }
            ]]
        },
        F = { owner = "pwntester", name = "octo.nvim" },
    }

COMMANDS                                        *octo-commands*

There is only one main command: `Octo <object> <action> [args]` command. If no
command is passed, the argument to `Octo` is treated as URL from where an
issue or PR number and repo are extracted.

Mappings for many of the commands can be easily configured - see |octo-config|.

<

You can pass GitHub URLs directly to the Octo command, including GitHub
Enterprise URLs:
>
  " GitHub.com URLs
  Octo https://github.com/pwntester/octo.nvim/issues/12
  Octo https://github.com/pwntester/octo.nvim/pull/123

  " GitHub Enterprise URLs (hostname is automatically detected)
  Octo https://ghe.example.com/owner/repo/issues/456
  Octo https://ghe.example.com/owner/repo/pull/789
<

You can also use `octo://` URLs to open issues and PRs directly:
>
  " Open from the default GitHub instance (github.com or configured github_hostname)
  :e octo://owner/repo/issue/123
  :e octo://owner/repo/pull/456

  " Open from a specific GitHub Enterprise instance
  :e octo://ghe.example.com/owner/repo/issue/123
  :e octo://ghe.example.com/owner/repo/pull/456

  " Both singular and plural forms are supported
  :e octo://owner/repo/issues/123
  :e octo://owner/repo/pulls/456
<

The `octo://` URL format is especially useful for:
- Opening issues/PRs from notes or wiki links without needing to be in the
  repository directory
- Working with multiple GitHub instances (e.g., GitHub.com and GitHub
  Enterprise) without setting `GH_HOST` globally
- Creating quick links in your workflow that work regardless of your current
  directory


CONFIGURATION                                   *octo-config*

See the README (<https://github.com/pwntester/octo.nvim>) for an example
configuration in Lua. Open with `:Octo repo view pwntester/octo.nvim`


PR REVIEW                                       *octo-pr-review*

 Open the PR (eg: `Octo <PR url>` or `Octo pr list` or `Octo pr edit <PR number>`)
* Start a review with `Octo review start` or resume a pending review with `Octo review resume`
 A new tab will show a panel with changed files and two windows showing the diff on any of them.
 Change panel entries with `]q` and `[q` or by selecting an entry in the window.
* Navigate to unviewed files with `]u` (next unviewed) and `[u` (previous unviewed).
* Add comments with `<localleader>ca` or suggestions with `<localleader>sa` on single or
  multiple visual-selected lines
  * A new buffer will appear in the alternate diff window. Cursor will be
    positioned in the new buffer
  * When ready, save the buffer to commit changes to GitHub
  * Move back to the diff window and move the cursor, the thread buffer will
    hide
* Hold the cursor on a line with a comment to show a thread buffer with all
  the thread comments
  * To modify, delete, react or reply to a comment, move to the window
    containing the thread buffer
  * Perform any operations as if you were in a regular issue buffer
* Review pending comments with `Octo review comments`
  * Use <CR> to jump to the selected pending comment
* If you want to review a specific commit, use `Octo review commit` to pick a commit.
  * The file panel will get filtered to show only files changed by that commit.
  * Any comments placed on these files will be applied at that specific commit level and will be
    added to the pending review.
* When ready, submit the review with `Octo review submit`
* A new float window will pop up. Enter the top level review comment and exit
  to normal mode. Then press <C-m> to submit a comment, <C-a> to approve
  it or <C-r> to request changes


COMPLETION                                      *octo-completion*

Octo provides a built-in omnifunc completion for issues, PRs and users that you can trigger using `<C-x><C-o>`. Alternately, if you use [`nvim-cmp`](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) or [`blink.cmp`](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp) for completion, you can use the [`cmp-git`](https://github.com/petertriho/cmp-git/) or [`blink-cmp-git`](https://github.com/Kaiser-Yang/blink-cmp-git) source to provide issues, PRs, commits and users completion.

Also,you can use [`cmp-emoji`](https://github.com/hrsh7th/cmp-emoji) or [`blink-emoji.nvim`](https://github.com/moyiz/blink-emoji.nvim) to get markdown emoji completion.

FAQ                                             *octo-faq*

How can I disable bubbles for XYZ?~

  Each text-object that makes use of a bubble (except labels) do use their own
  highlight group that links per default to the main bubble highlight group.
  To disable most bubbles at once you can simply link `OctoBubble` to
  `Normal`. To only disable them for a certain plain do the same for the
  specific sub-group (e.g. `OctoUser`).

Why do my issue titles or markdown syntax do not get highlighted properly?~

  The title, body and comments of an issue or PR are special as they get
  special highlighting applied and is an editable section. Due to the latter
  property it gets the `OctoEditable` highlighting via a special signs
  `linehl` setting. This takes precedence over the buffer internal highlights.
  To only get the background highlighted by the editable section, set
  `OctoEditable` to a highlight with a background color definition only.

Why am I getting authentication error from gh?~

  This means that are either using a GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate or `gh` is
  not authenticated.

  In case of the former, run:
>bash
  GITHUB_TOKEN= gh auth login
<
  ...and choose a method to authorise access for `gh`.
  `gh` must store the creds so it can work in a subshell.

Can I use treesitter markdown parser with octo buffers?~

  Just add the following lines to your TreeSitter config:
>lua
  vim.treesitter.language.register('markdown', 'octo')
<

*How can I filter PRs by filter keys that aren't available?~

  You can use the search command `:Octo search [query]`.
  The [search syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax) and available search terms are available in [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-author).

  For example to search for PRs with author you can use this command:

>vim
  :Octo search is:pr author:pwntester repo:github/codeql
<

  Note: You need to provide the `repo`, otherwise it will search for every PR by that user.

*How to enable autocompletion for issues/prs (`#`) and users (`@`)?~

  Add the following mappings for `octo` file type:

>lua
  vim.keymap.set("i", "@", "@<C-x><C-o>", { silent = true, buffer = true })
  vim.keymap.set("i", "#", "#<C-x><C-o>", { silent = true, buffer = true })


I can't see my v2 projects in issues and/or pull requests!~

  (and I see a warning when I open them)

  You are missing a scope from the token gh uses. You can add the scope to
  your gh token with

  `gh auth refresh -s read:project`

  Alternatively if you want to be able to modify projects (i.e. add/remove
  cards) you need to add the `project` scope to your token instead.

  If you don't care about projects v2 you can suppress the warning by setting
  `suppress_missing_scope.projects_v2 = true` in your Octo config.

How can I disable default key mappings?~
  set `mappings_disable_default = true` in user config.
