INTRODUCTION                                    *octo*

Edit and review GitHub issues and pull requests from the comfort of your
favorite editor.

Use `gO` to access the contents of this helpfile.


USAGE                                           *octo-usage*

Edit the issue title, body, or comments, as a regular buffer and use `:w(rite)`
to sync the issue with GitHub.


COMMANDS                                        *octo-commands*

There is only one main command: `Octo <object> <action> [args]` command. If no
command is passed, the argument to `Octo` is treated as URL from where an
issue or PR number and repo are extracted.

Mappings for many of the commands can be easily configured - see |octo-config|.

See |octo-command-examples| for examples.

COMPLETION                                      *octo-completion*

Octo provides a built-in omnifunc completion for issues, PRs and users that you can trigger using `<C-x><C-o>`. Alternately, if you use [`nvim-cmp`](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) for completion, you can use the [`cmp-git`](https://github.com/petertriho/cmp-git/) source to provide issues, PRs, commits and users completion.

FAQ                                             *octo-faq*

How can I disable bubbles for XYZ?~

  Each text-object that makes use of a bubble (except labels) do use their own
  highlight group that linkes per default to the main bubble highlight group.
  To disable most bubbles at once you can simply link `OctoBubble` to
  `Normal`. To only disable them for a certain plain do the same for the
  specific sub-group (e.g. `OctoUser`).

Why do my issue titles or markdown syntax do not get highlighted properly?~

  The title, body and comments of an issue or PR are special as they get
  special highlighting applied and is an editable section. Due to the latter
  property it gets the `OctoEditable` highlighting via a special signs
  `linehl` setting. This takes precedence over the buffer internal highlights.
  To only get the background highlighted by the editable section, set
  `OctoEditable` to a highlight with a background color definition only.

Why am I getting authentication error from gh?~

  This means that are either using a GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate or `gh` is
  not authenticated.

  In case of the former, run:
>bash
  GITHUB_TOKEN= gh auth login
<
  ...and choose a method to authorise access for `gh`.
  `gh` must store the creds so it can work in a subshell.

Can I use treesitter markdown parser with octo buffers?~

  Just add the following lines to your TreeSitter config:
>lua
  vim.treesitter.language.register('markdown', 'octo')
<

*How can I filter PRs by filter keys that aren't available?~

  You can use the search command `:Octo search [query]`.
  The [search syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax) and available search terms are available in [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-author).

  For example to search for PRs with author you can use this command:

>vim
  :Octo search is:pr author:pwntester repo:github/codeql
<

  Note: You need to provide the `repo`, otherwise it will search for every PR by that user.

*How to enable autocompletion for issues/prs (`#`) and users (`@`)?~

  Add the following mappings for `octo` file type:

>lua
  vim.keymap.set("i", "@", "@<C-x><C-o>", { silent = true, buffer = true })
  vim.keymap.set("i", "#", "#<C-x><C-o>", { silent = true, buffer = true })


I can't see my v2 projects in issues and/or pull requests!~

  (and I see a warning when I open them)

  You are missing a scope from the token gh uses. You can add the scope to
  your gh token with

  `gh auth refresh -s read:project`

  Alternatively if you want to be able to modify projects (i.e. add/remove
  cards) you need to add the `project` scope to your token instead.

  If you don't care about projects v2 you can suppress the warning by setting
  `suppress_missing_scope.projects_v2 = true` in your Octo config.

How can I disable default key mappings?~
  set `mappings_disable_default = true` in user config.
