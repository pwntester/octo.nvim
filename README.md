## 💫 Features

- Edit GitHub issues and PRs
- Add/Modify/Delete comments
- Add/Remove label, reactions, assignees, project cards, reviewers, etc.
- Add Review PRs

## 🎯 Requirements

- [Neovim `>=0.10.0`](https://neovim.io/)
- Install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
  - If you'd like to use [Projects v2](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects)
    you will need to add the `read:project` scope to your `gh` token. You can
    do so by running `gh auth refresh -s read:project`.
  - If you'd like to actually modify projects you can instead add the `project`
    scope to your token instead.
- Install [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
- Install one of:
  - [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
  - [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua)
- Install [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons)

## 📦 Installation

Use your favourite plugin manager to install it, e.g.:

```lua
use {
  'pwntester/octo.nvim',
  requires = {
    'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim',
    'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
    -- OR 'ibhagwan/fzf-lua',
    'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons',
  },
  config = function ()
    require"octo".setup()
  end
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

## 🚀 Usage

Just edit the issue title, body or comments as a regular buffer and use `:w(rite)` to sync the issue with GitHub.

## 🤖 Commands

There is only an `Octo <object> <action> [arguments]` command:
If no command is passed, the argument to `Octo` is treated as a URL from where an issue or pr repo and number are extracted.

5. Users in the assignee and reviewer commands:

- `search`: Dynamically search all GitHub users
- `mentionable`: List of *mentionable* users in current repo
- `assignable`: List of *assignable* users in current repo

  Here, `search` is the default value and most broad. Both `assignable` and
  `mentionable` are specific to the current repo. The `assignable` option is more
  restrictive than `mentionable`.

## 🔥 Examples

```vim
Octo https://github.com/pwntester/octo.nvim/issues/12
Octo issue create
Octo issue create pwntester/octo.nvim
Octo comment add
Octo reaction add hooray
Octo issue edit pwntester/octo.nvim 1
Octo issue edit 1
Octo issue list createdBy=pwntester
Octo issue list neovim/neovim labels=bug,help\ wanted states=OPEN
Octo search assignee:pwntester is:pr
```

## 📋 PR reviews

- Enter review mode for the current branch with `Octo review`. Alternatively open the PR (e.g. `Octo <PR url>` or `Octo pr list` or `Octo pr edit <PR number>`) then use `Octo review` in the PR buffer to enter review mode for a specific PR.
- A new tab will show a panel with changed files and two windows showing the diff on any of them.
- Change panel entries with `]q` and `[q` or by selecting an entry in the window
- Add comments with `<localleader>ca` or suggestions with `<localleader>sa` on single or multiple visual-selected lines
  - A new buffer will appear in the alternate diff window. The cursor will be positioned in the new buffer
  - When ready, save the buffer to commit changes to GitHub
  - Move back to the diff window and move the cursor, the thread buffer will hide
- Hold the cursor on a line with a comment to show a thread buffer with all the thread comments
  - To modify, delete, react or reply to a comment, move to the window containing the thread buffer
  - Perform any operations as if you were in a regular issue buffer
- Review pending comments with `Octo review comments`
  - Use <CR> to jump to the selected pending comment
- If you want to review a specific commit, use `Octo review commit` to pick a commit. The file panel will get filtered to show only files changed by that commit. Any comments placed on these files will be applied at that specific commit level and will be added to the pending review.
- When ready, submit the review with `Octo review submit`
- A new float window will pop up. Enter the top level review comment and exit to normal mode. Then press `<C-m>` to submit a comment, `<C-a>` to approve it or `<C-r>` to request changes

## 🍞 Completion

Octo provides a built-in omnifunc completion for issues, PRs and users that you can trigger using `<C-x><C-o>`. Alternately, if you use [`nvim-cmp`](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) for completion, you can use the [`cmp-git`](https://github.com/petertriho/cmp-git/) source to provide issues, PRs, commits and users completion.

The term `GitHub color` refers to the colors used in the WebUI.
The (addition) `viewer` means the user of the plugin or more precisely the user authenticated via the `gh` CLI tool used to retrieve the data from GitHub.

## 🙋 FAQ

**I get a warning saying `Cannot request projects v2, missing scope 'read:project'`**

That's expected. The new support for projects v2 support requires the `read:project` scope on your GitHub token.

You add the scope by using `gh auth refresh -s read:project` or you can suppress this warning by setting the following in your config

```
{
  suppress_missing_scope = {
    projects_v2 = true,
  }
}
```

**How can I disable bubbles for XYZ?**

Each text-object that makes use of a bubble (except labels) do use their own highlight group that links per default to the main bubble highlight group. To disable most bubbles at once you can simply link `OctoBubble` to `Normal`. To only disable them for a certain plain do the same for the specific sub-group (e.g. `OctoUser`).

**Why do my issue titles or markdown syntax do not get highlighted properly?**

The title, body and comments of an issue or PR are special as they get special highlighting applied and is an editable section. Due to the latter property it gets the `OctoEditable` highlighting via a special signs `linehl` setting. This takes precedence over the buffer internal highlights. To only get the background highlighted by the editable section, set `OctoEditable` to a highlight with a background color definition only.

**Why am I getting authentication error from gh?**

This means that are either using a GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate or `gh` is not authenticated.

In case of the former, run:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN= gh auth login
```

... and choose a method to authorise access for `gh`.

`gh` must store the credentials so it can work in a subshell.

**Can I use treesitter markdown parser with octo buffers?**

Just add the following lines to your TreeSitter config:

```lua
vim.treesitter.language.register('markdown', 'octo')
```

**How can I filter PRs by filter keys that aren't available?**

You can use the search command `:Octo search [query]`.
The [search syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax)
and available search terms are available in [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-author).

For example to search for PRs with author you can use this command:

```
:Octo search is:pr author:pwntester repo:github/codeql
```

Note: You need to provide the `repo`, otherwise it will search for every PR by that user.

**How to enable autocompletion for issues/prs (`#`) and users (`@`)?**

Add the following mappings for `octo` file type:

- `vim.keymap.set("i", "@", "@<C-x><C-o>", { silent = true, buffer = true })`
- `vim.keymap.set("i", "#", "#<C-x><C-o>", { silent = true, buffer = true })`

**How can I disable default key mappings?**

Set `mappings_disable_default = true` in user config.
